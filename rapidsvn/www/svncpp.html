<h3>SvnCpp C++ API</h3>

As part of the RapidSVN effort it became clear that it would make the code
easier to update and manage if the Subversion client C API were wrapped in C++. 
This is where SvnCpp comes from.  Right now it has the following aspects of the
C API have been abstracted: authentication, logging, status, notification, and
properties.  
SvnCpp should provide an object-oriented programming interface to any 
project that uses C++ or a <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG-compatible</a> 
language like Python or Java.
<p/>

To get the API you can download the source here with RapidSVN or svn:
