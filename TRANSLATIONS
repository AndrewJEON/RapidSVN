Creating translations for RapidSVN.

The directory structure for the user interface
translations is as follows:

rapidsvn
+-src
  +-locale
    +-rapidsvn.pot          This is a template file
    |                       containing all the strings
    |                       used in RapidSVN.
    +-de                    This is a directory that
      |                     contains the files
      |                     necessary for the
      |                     German translation
      +-rapidsvn.po         This file contains a plain-text
      |                     German translation
      +-rapidsvn.mo         Binary message catalog, that
                            will be used by RapidSVN to
                            display the translated user
                            interface.

Whenever a new text string in the RapidSVN source code
is added, updating the translation template rapidsvn.pot and
all the translated rapidsvn.po files is necessary.

Since there are not too many changes to the user interface
between subsequent releases of RapidSVN it is sufficient to
update that translation a week or two before creating a new 
release.

The following steps have to be performed for updating the
translation:

1. Recreate the template file

   Open a shell and change to "src/locale"

   Extract all the strings in the cpp source code files 
   (only strings that should be translated are marked by
   _("my string")):
  
     xgettext -o rapidsvn.pot -k_ ../*.cpp


2. Merge the old translations and the new strings

   This step has to be performed for every language.

   Change to "src/locale/<language>" (e.g. "src/locale/de")

   Save the old translation:
     mv rapidsvn.po rapidsvn.po.old

   Now merge the information:
     msgmerge -o rapidsvn.po rapidsvn.po.old ../rapidsvn.pot


3. Update the translations

   This step has to be performed for every language.

   The most easy way to check and update a translation is
   to use the tool poEdit:
  
     poedit rapidsvn.po


4. Compile the translations

   This step has to be performed for every language.

   Change to the directory "src/locale/<locale>".

   Compile the translation:
     msgfmt -o rapidsvn.mo rapidsvn.po


5. Check the result in RapidSVN

   Change to "src".

   Set the appropriate locale:
     export LANG=<locale> (e.g. de_DE, en_US)

   Run rapidsvn and check the user interface.
